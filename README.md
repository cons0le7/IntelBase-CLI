- The first time tool is ran it will ask for your API token. Once token is provided it will be stored as a file 'api.key' and retrieved automatically for authentication anytime the script is ran in the future. 
- After initial token authentication, you have options to search email, update your api token, or exit.
- After performing an email search you will be given the option to save the response as a JSON file.
